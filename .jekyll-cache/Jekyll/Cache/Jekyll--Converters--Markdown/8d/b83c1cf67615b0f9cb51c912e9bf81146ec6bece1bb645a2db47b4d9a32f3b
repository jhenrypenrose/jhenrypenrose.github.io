I"’<p>Iâ€™m an analyst, a music nerd, an avid bread baker living in Raleigh, NC. Iâ€™m currently an Assistant Media Planner at McKinney. I focus on numbers-driven insights and the power of stories for brands. â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹</p>

Previously, I have served as the General Manager of WSOE 89.3 FM â€“ Elon Uniâ€™s student-run radio station and as the Creative Director of Live Oak Communications â€“ Elonâ€™s student-run PR and advertising agency.

I have a varied background and a breadth of experience.</p>
